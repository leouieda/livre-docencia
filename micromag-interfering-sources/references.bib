abstract = {When magnetic crystals form in rocks and meteorites, they can record the ancient magnetic field and retain this information over geological timescales. Scientists use these magnetic recordings to study the evolution of the Earth and the Solar System. Previous theories for the recording mechanisms of the magnetic crystals in rocks and meteorites are based on the idea that the magnetic structures within crystals are near uniform. However, from numerous studies we know this not to be true. The crystals are too large in size and display complex nonuniform “vortex” structures. In this study we have shown that vortex structures are capable of recording and retaining magnetic signals over billions of years.},

abstract = {Paleomagnetic data is collected from bulk samples, containing a mixture of stable and unstable magnetic particles. Recently, magnetic microscopy techniques have allowed the examination of individual magnetic grains. However, accurately determining the magnetic moments of these grains is difficult and time-consuming due to the inherent ambiguity of potential field data and the large number of grains in each image. Here we introduce a fast and semi-automated algorithm that estimates the position and magnetization of each magnetic source solely based on magnetic microscopy data, without requiring any additional information. The algorithm follows a three-step process. Firstly, it employs image processing techniques to identify and isolate data window boundaries for each magnetic source. Secondly, the algorithm uses Euler deconvolution to estimate their positioning. Lastly, the algorithm solves an overdetermined linear inverse problem, using a dipolar approximation, to determine the direction and intensity of the magnetic dipole moment for each source. To validate the algorithm, we conducted tests analyzing particle depth, intensity, and non-dipolarity. Additionally, synthetic data experiments were performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the methodology in recovering the position and magnetic information of both dipolar and non-dipolar sources. These experiments included complex samples designed to simulate real rock data. Then, we applied it to real data, where it accurately retrieved the expected directions induced in the sample. The semi-automated nature of our algorithm, combined with its low processing cost and ability to simultaneously analyze the magnetic moments of numerous particles, represents a significant advancement in facilitating paleomagnetic applications of magnetic microscopy..},

abstract = {The constitution of rock and mineral magnetism and its 'applications' or 'connections' are discussed in section 1.3. Some applications depend on the physical models of rock and mineral magnetism, and the extent to which rock and mineral magnetism research has provided experimental support for the models. The models essentially concern the acquisition and rem oval of weak field remanences, and form the physical basis for determinations of the direction and intensity ofthe ancient geomagnetic field, and the inferences which can be made from such adetermination. The models also suggest methods by which the palaeomagnetic signal may be distinguished from 'noise'. The models are applied in geological problems, such as the determination of emplacement temperatures, or in 'magnetic granulometry' with many areas of interest from technology to cosmology. A second species of application is found in the methods and techniques of rock and mineral magnetism, largely the determination of the composition, concentration and microstructure of the magnetic fraction of a rock or artefact. This provides the chemical basis of palaeomagnetism and palaeo-intensity studies, and can be used to monitor changes induced in a rock or artefact during laboratory heating. It also finds application as a tool in petrology, in environmental studies, and in the biologicaljmedical area. The knowledge and experience of rock and mineral magnetism also finds application in a number of other areas which might be grouped together under the heading of 'planetary physics'. They often involve large-scale phenomena, in some cases at remote distances, or the properties of inaccessible materials. Several questions-the properties of the source material contributing to the magnetic field measured at the surface of the Earth or other Earth-type planet, the depth of the Curie point isotherm, the origin of the seismomagnetic and volcanomagnetic effects, the magnetic and magneto-mineralogical effects of meteoritic impact, and the mechanism of magnetiza-tion of the crusts of Earth-type bodies in the solar system-may find some answer in the body of rock and mineral magnetism knowledge.},

abstract = {Abstract Reliability of magnetic recordings of the ancient magnetic field is strongly dependent on the magnetic mineralogy of natural samples. Theoretical estimates of long-term stability of remanence were restricted to single-domain (SD) states, but micromagnetic models have recently demonstrated that the so-called single-vortex (SV) domain structure can have even higher stability that SD grains. In larger grains ( 10 μm in magnetite) the multidomain (MD) state dominates, so that large uniform magnetic domains are separated by narrow domain walls. In this paper we use a parallelized micromagnetic finite element model to provide resolutions of many millions of elements allowing us, for the first time, to examine the evolution of magnetic structure from a uniform state, through the SV state up to the development of the domain walls indicative of MD states. For a cuboctahedral grain of magnetite, we identify clear domain walls in grains as small as ∼3 μm with domain wall widths equal to that expected in large MD grains; we therefore put the SV to MD transition at ∼3 μm for magnetite and expect well-defined, and stable, SV structures to be present until at least ∼1 μm when reducing the grain size. Reducing the size further shows critical dependence on the history of domain structures, particularly with SV states that transition through a so-called “unstable zone” leading to the recently observed hard-aligned SV states that proceed to unwind to SD yet remain hard aligned.},
